This project was created for educational purposes and to have fun with 3D in browser.
Check it out yourself -> http://markshulhin.github.io/

You can find main code in this directory: src/js/main.js

Things you can do: <br/>
  • Change the speed of wind and see how turbine will react.<br/>
  • Charge the battery and enjoy the animation.<br/>
  • Power on/off the electricity and waste some energy.<br/>
  • Click the "STOP ALL" button, if you suspect some danger.<br/>
  • Have some fun ☺<br/>
  <br/>
 Turbine will generate some electric energy in some range of wind speed ( 3 to 23 km/h ).<br/>
 To make things more difficult, since turbine can't turn around(for now), there is only 3 wind directions<br/>
 that cause the turbine to generate energy(North and 2 more).
